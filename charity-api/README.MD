# RESTful API for Charity Fundraising
This project is a RESTful API for managing charity fundraising events, collection boxes, and generating reports. 
It is built using Spring Boot and follows a microservices architecture.

## üöÄ Running the Application

Follow the steps below to start all microservices locally (without Docker).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filip7243/charity-api
cd charity-api
```

### 2. Build all modules

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 3. Start the microservices (in this order)

Tip: üí° Open a new terminal for each service.

#### 3.1 Discovery Server (Eureka)

```bash
cd discovery-server
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 3.2 Gateway

```bash
cd api-gateway
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 3.3 Charity Service

```bash
cd charity-service
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 3.4 Report Service

```bash
cd report-service
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 3.5 Currency Service

```bash
cd currency-service
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Open H2 console

- Check charity-service port (should be in the console after starting the service)
- Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:<CHARITY_SERVICE_PORT>/h2-console
- Login with the following credentials:
    - **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:charity_db`
    - **User Name**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `admin`

## üê≥ Running the Application with Docker

You can also run the entire microservices architecture using **Docker Compose**.

### 1. Build and start all containers

In the root directory of the project (charity-api), run:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Then, from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

üïí Important: After all services start, wait a few seconds for them to register with the Eureka server. The system might
take a short moment to stabilize.

### 2. Access the services

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080/
- **Eureka Server**: http://localhost:8761/
- **Eureka Server Health**: http://localhost:8761/actuator/health

### ‚ö†Ô∏è H2 Console Note

When running with Docker:

- H2 Console is not available in the browser.
- The in-memory H2 databases exist only inside each container and are not accessible externally.

If you need database access for testing or debugging, consider running the services manually without Docker.

### üì¶ Stopping the containers

```
docker-compose down
```

You can also test the endpoint using Postman or any other API testing tool.
In the ```./postman``` directory, you can find a collection with all endpoints in JSON format,
import and have fun :)

## üöÄ Architecture
This application is based on a microservices architecture, where each domain-specific functionality is implemented as a separate service.

### Key Components:
- **API GATEWAY**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It listens on port 8080 and routes the requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Eureka Discovery Server**: All microservices register themselves with Eureka, which serves as a service registry. This enables dynamic discovery of services without hardcoding their locations.
- **Load Balancing**: Services communicate with each other using REST over HTTP, leveraging load-balanced URIs (lb://service-name) through Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design
The application uses a relational database schema with the following key entities:
- ```CollectionBox```: Represents a physical collection box used during fundraising events. It holds a list of Money entries and is linked to a single FundraisingEvent.

- ```FundraisingEvent```: Represents an event during which funds are collected. It stores the name of the event and the total amount collected (as a Money value).

- ```Money```: An embeddable value object that represents a monetary amount and its currency code. It is used both inside the CollectionBox (as a collection of embedded values) and in FundraisingEvent (as a single embedded value).
